# To-Do-List
A basic to do list in React

Instructions:

1) Open Terminal on Mac, and enter :
npm install -g create-react-app
npx create-react-app todolist
cd todolist
npm start

2) Install different React packages

3) Open all the files in Visual Studio Code

4) A web page opens up with the link: http://localhost:3000/

5) When making changes to the code in Visual Studio, click "save all" and then the web page updates.

The bug I've been trying to decode: Why the tasks don't get added after I've written code to add buttons that compiles.
